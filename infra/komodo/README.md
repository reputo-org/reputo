# Komodo deployment

Komodo is the deployment control plane for Reputo staging and production. This directory holds everything Git-tracked that Komodo needs.

```

Each `stacks/<name>/` folder is self-contained: the Stack TOML, the Compose file it deploys, and any service-specific configs that only that stack consumes. Cross-cutting resources (servers, variables, user-groups, alerters) live at the root because they span every stack. Procedures sit at the root for the same reason — `deploy-all-*` and `deploy-infra-*` cross stack boundaries. There is no per-stack `.env.example`; the staging/production contract is the stack's `environment` block plus [resources/variables.toml](resources/variables.toml), and the dev contract is the root [`.env.example`](../../.env.example).

## Stack model

Four stacks per environment. Each is a separate Komodo Stack and a separate Docker Compose project on the host.

| Stack | Folder | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reputo-database-{env}` | [stacks/database/](stacks/database/) | API Postgres + onchain-data Postgres + on-demand `postgres-backup` |
| `reputo-temporal-{env}` | [stacks/temporal/](stacks/temporal/) | Temporal server, UI, Postgres, Elasticsearch |
| `reputo-observability-{env}` | [stacks/observability/](stacks/observability/) | Loki, Promtail, Prometheus, cAdvisor, node-exporter, Grafana |
| `reputo-apps-{env}` | [stacks/apps/](stacks/apps/) | Traefik, UI, API, workflow workers |

Why this split:

- **Statefulness:** each datastore (application Postgres, Temporal's own cluster, observability TSDBs) lives in its own stack so a restart of one does not bounce the others.
- **Lifecycle:** apps deploy on every merge to `main`; data and observability rarely move. Putting them in separate stacks keeps app deploys fast and low-blast-radius.
- **Ingress:** Traefik lives with apps because its labels and CORS middleware are reissued on every routing change. The Traefik container only restarts when its own config or env changes; service routes update via the Docker provider.

All four stacks join the shared external bridge network `${COMPOSE_NETWORK_NAME:-reputo}`, created on the host by the periphery installer.

## Source of truth

[resource-sync.toml](resource-sync.toml) at the root declares one `ResourceSync` named `reputo-main`. It scans `infra/komodo/resource-sync.toml`, `infra/komodo/procedures.toml`, `infra/komodo/resources/`, and `infra/komodo/stacks/` (recursing into each per-stack folder for `stack.toml` files).

Settings used:

- `managed = false`, `delete = false` — sync runs are reviewable and non-destructive.
- `include_resources = true`, `include_user_groups = true`.
- `include_variables = false` after first-time bootstrap (see [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)).

## Variables and secrets

Komodo has three distinct secret locations. Putting the right value in the right place matters because they're read at different times by different processes:

| Location | Read by | What lives here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `infra/komodo/core/core.env` on the Core VM | Komodo Core at startup | `KOMODO_PASSKEY`, `KOMODO_JWT_SECRET`, `KOMODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `KOMODO_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `KOMODO_GITHUB_OAUTH_*`, `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` (for Traefik in front of Core). |
| `/etc/komodo/periphery.config.toml` on each Periphery host | The Periphery agent at startup | The Core public key, the connect-as name, optionally a `[secrets]` block (host-scoped secrets — see [official docs](https://komo.do/docs/resources/variables)). |
| Komodo Variables ([resources/variables.toml](resources/variables.toml) + UI values) | Komodo Core when materializing Stack / Procedure / Alerter resources | Every `STAGING_*` / `PRODUCTION_*` app environment value, plus `KOMODO_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` (interpolated into the alerter). |

[resources/variables.toml](resources/variables.toml) declares only the *names* + `is_secret` flags; values are set in the Komodo UI (`Settings > Variables`). Each stack's TOML interpolates them as `[[NAME]]` references — resolved values never appear in this repo.

Convention for Variables:

- Per-environment values: prefix `STAGING_` or `PRODUCTION_`.
- Cross-environment values that are interpolated into a Komodo resource (today: just `KOMODO_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`): no prefix.
- Secrets: variable name ends in `_SECRET`, `_KEY`, `_PASSWORD`, or `_TOKEN`, and `is_secret = true`.

What does **not** belong in Variables:

- `KOMODO_PASSKEY`, `KOMODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `KOMODO_JWT_SECRET`, `KOMODO_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, the OAuth client ID/secret — these are read at Core process startup, *before* the variable subsystem exists. They live in `core.env`.
- Per-resource `webhook_secret` overrides. Komodo Core falls back to the global `KOMODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from `core.env` automatically, and that's the value GitHub Actions also signs with. Don't reintroduce `webhook_secret = "[[…]]"` on Stacks/Procedures.
- Periphery server addresses. With the outbound Periphery → Core flow, Core auto-fills `Server.address` when the agent registers.

The runtime contract for each stack is the `environment` block in its `stack.toml`. For local development, the root [`.env.example`](../../.env.example) is the single template. There is no per-stack `.env.example` because it would just duplicate the TOML and drift.

To add a new value: append the entry in `resources/variables.toml`, set `include_variables = true` once, sync, fill the value in the UI, flip `include_variables` back to `false`. See [docs/komodo.md](../../docs/komodo.md) for the full cutover detail.

## Procedures

[procedures.toml](procedures.toml) defines every Procedure:

| Procedure | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `deploy-database-{env}` | Deploy the database stack on one environment. |
| `deploy-temporal-{env}` | Deploy the temporal stack. |
| `deploy-observability-{env}` | Deploy the observability stack. |
| `deploy-apps-{env}` | Deploy the apps stack (re-deploy only; promote-production is the normal release path for prod). |
| `deploy-infra-{env}` | Sequence: database → temporal → observability. |
| `deploy-all-{env}` | Sequence: database → temporal → observability → apps. Cold-start. |
| `restart-apps-{env}` | Restart apps containers without re-pulling images. |
| `backup-data-{env}` | Run the one-shot `postgres-backup` service. Output goes to the `backups` named volume. |
| `promote-production` | Production app deploy after the GitHub Actions digest retag. Called via webhook from `promote-production.yml`. |
| `prune-images` | Daily scheduled image prune on both staging and production. |

## Deploy paths

- **Staging apps:** GitHub Actions builds images, pushes `staging` + `sha-<commit>` tags, then calls `https://komodo.logid.xyz/listener/github/stack/reputo-apps-staging/deploy`. The stack pulls and recreates. No human in the loop.
- **Production apps:** the `Promote to Production` workflow retags `sha-<commit>` to `production` + `prod-<commit>` by digest, then calls the `promote-production` Procedure webhook.
- **Infra / temporal / observability:** these never deploy from CI. Trigger from the Komodo UI via the matching `deploy-*` Procedure or directly on the stack.
- **Backups:** trigger `backup-data-{env}` from the Komodo UI, or schedule it later by setting `schedule` / `schedule_enabled` on the procedure.

## Host prerequisites (per Periphery host)

1. Docker Engine + Compose plugin.
2. A reachable private IP for the Komodo Core → Periphery connection.
3. Run [periphery/install.sh](periphery/install.sh) (idempotent). The script creates the shared bridge network named `reputo` if it does not exist.
4. Create the writable host paths the stacks expect:
   - `TRAEFIK_CERTS_PATH` (default `/var/lib/reputo/traefik/certs`) — owned by the traefik container UID and `chmod 600` for the ACME store.
5. Make sure the `reputo-org/reputo` GHCR PAT is configured in Komodo under `Settings > Providers` if the registry needs auth.

## Adding a service

Decide which stack it belongs to by lifecycle:

- **Stateful, rarely-changing** → `database` or `temporal` (or a new stack if it is independent).
- **Long-lived agent for metrics/logs** → `observability`.
- **Stateless, deploys with the apps** → `apps`.

Then:

1. Add the service to the chosen `stacks/<name>/compose.yml`.
2. Add any new env vars to the stack's `environment` block in `stacks/<name>/stack.toml` and (for new secrets) [resources/variables.toml](resources/variables.toml). Also add them to the root [`.env.example`](../../.env.example) so local dev knows about them.
3. Merge, sync `reputo-main`, deploy the affected stack.
